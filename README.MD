# CS Game (Zork)

This game is a project to understand better c# and Entity Framework.

## Synopsis
This game is inspired by the japanese TV Show "Takeshi Castle" where there is multiple obstacles and mini games whose one is a labyrinth.

In this Labyrinth, you walk through by going through doors, discovering the other rooms, while being chased by 3 monsters.

If you encounters 1, you have to defeat it or flee to be free.

You win by finding the exit.

## Installation

To play this game, you have to import it in Visual Studio and run it !
Be sure to have .NET 5.0 installed

If you encounter errors during the build process or during the installation, please contact me to fix this.

## Extras
I decided to make an simple Easter Egg by healing the player when he select 42 in a fight (even if it is not shown). You can see the corresponding condition in the Gameplay.cs file in cs-game/Scenes.
